# CBOM.ai â€” Cryptographic Bill of Materials Demo

This repository contains a Maestro-based proofâ€‘ofâ€‘concept that generates a Cryptographic Bill of Materials (CBOM) for a given GitHub Java project. It orchestrates a pipeline of autonomous agents to:

(1) Fetch all .java file URLs from a GitHub repo.

(2) Select a target file at random (or by position).

(3) Read the raw content of that file.

(4) Identify uses of postâ€‘quantumâ€‘vulnerable crypto APIs or functions.

(5) Aggregate findings into CycloneDXâ€‘style component entries.

(6) Assemble a complete CBOM JSON document.

## ðŸ“¦ Architecture & Agents

### 1. Git Fetcher

Purpose: Recursively list .java files via GitHubâ€™s Trees API.

Output: Python list of raw.githubusercontent URLs.

### 2. Selector

Purpose: Choose one URL from the list (first element or random).

Output: Single URL string.

### 3. Raw GH Reader

Purpose: Fetch full file content via HTTP (requests).

Output: Plain Java source text.

### 4. Postâ€‘Quantum Identifier

Purpose: Scan source for nonâ€‘quantumâ€‘safe crypto (AES, RSA, Cipher.getInstance, etc.).

Output: JSON array of occurrences with algorithm, line, snippet.

### 5. Component Creator

Purpose: Group occurrences by algorithm into CycloneDX components.

Output: JSON array of component objects with bom-ref, evidence, cryptoProperties.

### 6. BOM Assembler

Purpose: Wrap header, metadata, components, dependencies into a final CBOM.

Output: Complete CycloneDX BOM JSON document.

## Remediation and PR automation

After generating a CycloneDX-formatted CBOM, the system can optionally apply automated remediations and open a GitHub pull request(s) with the proposed fixes.

### 7. Fixer Agent

Parses the CBOM to identify components using non-recommended configurations (e.g., AES-128).

Applies remediation strategies from LLM-based suggestions to upgrade values (e.g., 128 â†’ 256).

Generates a .patch file using git format-patch from the staged change.

### 8. Patcher Agent

Takes the generated patch and applies it to a clean clone of the target GitHub repository.

Pushes the changes to a new branch (e.g., remediation_4821).

Uses the GitHub CLI (gh pr create) to open a pull request into the original repoâ€™s main branch.

#### Permissions & Token Requirements

To apply patches and create pull requests, the following permissions are required:

A GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) with the repo scope.

The token must be exported as an environment variable:

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_...
```

#### Running

This demo uses the ollama backend, and specifically both the `qwen3:latest` and `granite3.2:latest` models. 

In addition, there are 2 custom tools that need to be created and enabled:
(1) java-fetcher

```python
    import requests

    def get_java_file_urls(owner: str, repo: str, branch: str = "main") -> list[str]:
        """
        Retrieve raw.githubusercontent.com URLs for all .java files in a GitHub repo
        by using the Git Trees API with recursion.

        :param owner: GitHub org/user name (e.g., "Mastercard")
        :param repo: Repository name (e.g., "client-encryption-java")
        :param branch: Branch name (default: "main")
        :param token: GitHub Personal Access Token (optional for private repos or rate limiting)
        :return: List of raw.githubusercontent.com URLs for each .java file
        """
        
        tree_api_url = f"https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/git/trees/{branch}?recursive=1"
    
        response = requests.get(tree_api_url)
        response.raise_for_status()
        tree_data = response.json().get("tree", [])
        
        java_urls = []
        for entry in tree_data:
            if entry.get("type") == "blob" and entry.get("path", "").endswith(".java"):
                raw_url = f"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/{owner}/{repo}/{branch}/{entry['path']}"
                java_urls.append(raw_url)
        
        return java_urls
```

(2) fetch_code

```python
    import requests

    def fetch_raw_file_content(url: str) -> str:
        """
        Fetch the full content of a raw.githubusercontent.com URL using HTTP.

        :param url: Raw file URL (e.g., https://raw.githubusercontent.com/.../AesEncrypter.java)
        :return: The file content as a text string
        """
        response = requests.get(url)
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.text
```

To run: `maestro run ./demos/workflows/cbom.ai/workflow.yaml`
